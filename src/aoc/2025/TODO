DAY 8
- Write better solution with Union Find

DAY 9
- I got the correct answer, but I did not realize that my solution works only because the 
  input data draw a particular shape, which I did't visualize myself.
- Rewrote with brute-force ray-tracing, took 3h to get to the correct answer. I will try to 
  implement compressed ray-tracing (e.g. do not cycle over all pts to form an horizontal ray, 
  but cycle on the intervals separated by the shape's perimeter).

DAY 10
- Maybe try to implement ILP solver myself...? (Yeah, sure)
- I found a very interesting analytic approach in AoC subreddit (https://shorturl.at/LT2FJ),
  it would be lovely to give it a try.

DAY 12
- A friend of mine fed Claude with puzzle + input. Claude wrote a solution involving
  Knuth's dancing links algorithm (https://shorturl.at/08gH6), which gives the correct
  answer both for the example and for the input. I think it would be  interesting to 
  understand how that works.
